            <p className="">Iâ€™m a computer science and industrial design student at Georgia Tech. Go Jackets and THWg always! I am passionate about using technology to build both innovative and creative solutions. 
            </p>

            <p> Outside of school, I love to travel. I previously completed a Co-Op at Delta Air Lines which was an incredible experience. I got to see and experience so many different places and cultures, while being able to develop my engineering skill set. 
            </p>

            <p>I love that computer science and indistrial design have given me the tools to express my creativity in so many ways- from building video games, to designing learning platforms, and so much more</p>
